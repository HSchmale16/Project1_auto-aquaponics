This is an automatic message from the autoaquaponics system notifying
you that a certain sensor went out of bounds.

The "<%= sensor %>" sensor had a value of <%= value %>.
This is out of range of the constriaints set as <%= constraint.low %> and
<%= constraint.high %>. You should probably come and correct this.
